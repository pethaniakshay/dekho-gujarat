    <b><h1>Takhteshwar Temple</h1></b>

    <h4>The  Takhteshwar Temple is situated in the heart of the city atop a hillock. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and was constructed way back in the 18th century.
<br> It was named after an ardent patron called Takhtsinhji. One can enjoy some stunning views of the entire city sitting here right from the altar or the marble white courtyard.

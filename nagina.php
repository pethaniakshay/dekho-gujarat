    <b><h1>Nagina Wadi</h1></b>

    <h4> Nagina Wadi is a garden themed entertainment ground in the center of the circular Kankaria Lake at the Ahmedabad metropolitan area in Gujarat, India.<br> Nagina Wadi is accessed by a straight, concrete, tree-lined walkway traversing half of the lake. In early 2009, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and AIL Amrapali Industries Limited ( Amrapali Group ) built and completed a large lighted musical fountain, featuring brilliant multicolored laser lights displayed during the night.

    <b><h1>Jama Masjid</h1></b>

    <h4> The Jama Masjid of Ahmedabad was probably the largest mosque in the Indian subcontinent built in this period. <br> Designed as part of a major plan desired by the Emperor Sultan Ahmed Shah, the mosque is located south of the processional axis that runs from the Maidan-i Shah at the door with three arches, Teen Darwaza. 
    To the west of the mosque are the tombs of Ahmed Shah I, his son and his grandson, Ahmed Shah's Tomb. Nearby are the graves of the queens and the other wives of the king, Rani no Hajiro.
